## Hi there

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning basic math skills, including algebra and mathematical analysis. I've invested a lot of after-school time in teaching myself computers, and I hope I can learn more.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking forward to participating in open-source projects related to deep learning, while learning along the way.

ðŸ¤” I'm looking for programming advice and inspiration for deep learning projects!

ðŸ“« How to reach me: contact me in Git Hub is all right.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: You can call me whatever you like.
